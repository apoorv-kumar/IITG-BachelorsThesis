\begin_layout Chapter
Wireless NoC (WiNoC)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CMOS based wireless interconnection enables on-chip multi-hop communication
 by the embedding wireless channels.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows a simplistic base case of wireless on-chip communication.
 One of the PE decides to send data to another.
 It forwards the data to the Digital to Analog Conversion unit (DAC) that
 is responsible to encode the digital data in analog format using one of
 the schemes discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:ADEncoding"

\end_inset

.
 Once the conversion is done, the analog data is forwarded to the transmitter
 that pushes the data onto the channel .
 Upon reception, the receiver transfers the data to Analog to Digital Conversion
 (ADC) unit, which in turn translates the analog signal into its constituent
 digital information.
 This digital data is conveyed to the recipient PE, thus completing the
 process of transmission.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process of broadcast on the channel provides unprecendented flexibility
 to the setup and thus allows completely reconfigurable topologies supporting
 a wide range to routing strategies.
 Interestingly, a satisfactory implementation can be conceived using the
 current CMOS technology without the need of embedding a foreign technology.
 The wireless links serve as a high-bandwidth and low-latency replacement
 for the wired multihop connects.

Depending upon these factors the power involved in transmitting a bit (on
 average) can vary tremendously across chips.
 However, we can create a generic model.

Internal Characteristics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Frequency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, we need to choose the bandwidth we want to operate on.
 This might vary from the tera Hz region to a few giga Hz.
 It is arguably the most important design decision, determining other aspects
 like design of wireless transceivers and peformance of physical layer.
 The WiNoCs primarily under the radar of current research can be classified
 into four broad groups according to the frequency in which they operate
 (depicted in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Ultra Wide Band (UWB)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
UWB lies at the lower end of the wireless spectrum that can be used on NoCs.
 This band has been well established in terms of feasibility of implementation
 by various groups, notably by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "4531729"

\end_inset

, who utilize a carrier-free impluse radio-based UWB transciever to design
 a WiNoC.
 The transmitter is designed to generate the desired pulse with suitable
 driving strength so that signal can be efÔ¨Åciently radiated from an on-chip
 antenna.
 A CMOS integrated Gaussian monocycle pulse (GMP) generator creates an ultra
 short pulse that yeilds a very low power spectral density.
 The receiver constitutes of a wideband LNA, a correlator, an ADC, and synchroni
zation circuits.
 It employs a 2.98-mm-long meander type dipole antenna that gives 1 mm data
 transmission range, whereas the transceiver can give a sustained data rate
 of 1.16 Gb/s on a channel with central frequency of 3.6 GHz.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
mm Wave
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As per the ITRS, for the 16nm CMOS technology, the cutoff frequency and
 unity maximum available power gain frequency are targetted between 600
 GHz and 1 THz, respectively.
 This level of scaling assists in integrating the WiNoC units on chip as
 the units themselves are expected to scale proportionally.
 This also allows us to explore mm-wave as potential frequency candidate
 in WiNoCs.
 The on-chip antenna should provide us with the best power gain with minimal
 power and area requirements.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 presents a metal zig-zag antenna as one of the most apt candidates for
 the purpose.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 shows that a 0.38-mm antenna can achieve a 3 dB bandwidth of 16 GHz with
 a central frequency of 57.5 GHz.

\end_inset

 argues that the metal lines over the antenna doesn't affect the the gain
 factor, thus making it compatible with the current fabrication process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
sub-THz Wave
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The minimum antenna size scales down with the wavelength.
 This makes sub-THz region all the more lucrative as it saves real estate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 recommends that the antenna be put in a polyimide layer, deposited of the
 top silicon, such that most electromagnetic energy could be conÔ¨Åned within
 this low-loss dielectric layer.
 It observes that our primary aim should be to minimize the radiation penetratin
g into the substrate since substrate loss is a major factor in determining
 chip performance.
 The low loss polyimide layer can be shown to constrain most of the signal
 within the layer, boosting the range of communication to a centimeter.
 Since it is possible to switch a CMOS transistor as fast as 500 GHz at
 32 nm CMOS, this allows us to implement a large number of high frequency
 bands for the on-chip wireless network.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

Using a 32 nm CMOS process, empirically, there are expected be total of
 16 available channels, from 100 GHz to 500 GHz, for the on-chip wireless
 network, and each channel can transmit at 10 to 20 Gbps, putting the raw
 aggregate data rate to upto 320 Gbps.
 Again,

 predicts that only 1-2% of the power would be used in wireless communication
 with a simple ASK transceiver implementation.

The mm-wave frequency band can provide abundant bandwidth while not suffering
 from severe signal degradation, thanks to the short communication distances
 in the WiNoC.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lee:2009:SMW:1614320.1614345"

\end_inset

, a noncoherent on‚Äìoff keying (OOK) based transceiver is designed for an
 mm-wave WiNoC, OOK being selected as it allows relatively simple and low-power
 circuit implementation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
THz Wave
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As observed before, increase in communication frequency is a win-win scenario.
 Antenna characteristics of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the THz/optical frequency
 range has been well investigated
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "4420100"

\end_inset

.
 These antennas can achieve a bandwidth of around 500 GHz, whereas antennas
 operating in the millimeter wave range achieve bandwidths of tens of gigahertz.
 A higher frequency-bandwidth translates into a higher data rate.
 Certain specific characteristics of CNTs make them well suited for the
 purpose.
 Extremely low wavelength demands a very thin antenna structure for efficient
 transmission and reception.
 CNTs are naturally just a few nanometers across in diameter, what is virtually
 impossible to acheive using any other fabrication technique.
 Secondly, the virtually defect free CNTs show minimal surface loss and
 thus can detect weak signals very effectively.

To ensure the high throughput and energy efÔ¨Åciency of the WiNoC, the transceiver
 circuitry has to provide a very wide bandwidth as well as low power consumption.
 In designing the on-chip mm-wave wireless transceiver, low power design
 considerations need to be taken into account both at the architecture and
 circuit levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Meander type dipole antenna
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A meander type (linear) dipole antenna is one of the simplest kinds, made
 of two conductors separated by a small distance, with a center-fed driven
 element as shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "wrap:fig:dipole"

\end_inset

.
 The signal voltage is applied to the antenna at the center, between the
 two conductors.
 The characteristic waves produced by them is shown in

 As apparent, the

 scales proportionally with transistor size, whereas bandwidth scales inversely,
 making it a viable prospect for the future.

Zig-Zag antenna
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A zig-zag antenna (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "wrap:fig_zigzag"

\end_inset

) can be seen as a squashed helical antenna with planar geometry for ease
 in fabrication.As discussed previously, it has been often used for mm-wave
 communication to enhance the communication range over a centimeter.
 The viability in terms of implementation has been demonstrated in an early
 effort in
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "1386412"

\end_inset

 used for distributing clock signals.
 The signal frequency is 14.3 GHz, and the power incident to the antenna
 is 21 dBm.
 Zig-zag antenna is often implemented as a dipole antenna, with the zig-zag
 structure replacing the usual linear conductor.

CNT antenna
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to a fundamentally different material and structures, CNT is quite different
 from the metal thin-wire antenna.
 The antenna performance such as gain can be adjusted by changing the conductivi
ty of composite, while it is not possible for materials with fixed conductivity
 such as copper.
 As already discussed, CNTs are sleek and just a few nanometers across in
 diameter and they show minimal surface loss due to being defect-free.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "5976397"

\end_inset

 reports that the bandwidth of a CNT composite single antenna beats that
 of copper antenna operating over the 24 to 34 GHz frequency range.
 It further shows the effectivity of CNT based antenna in the mm-wave region.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "4420100"

\end_inset

 discusses its characteristics of low radiation resistance and efficiency
 in the THz range.
 It also recommends using a bundle of CNTs, claiming a 30 dB improvement
 in efficiency at 2 THz resonance frequency when using a rectangular geometry
 bundle.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Misewich02052003"

\end_inset

, it has been demonstrated that semiconducting CNTs emit infrared photons
 when an electron-hole pair recombines across the band- gap.
 Thus, the CNT also acts as the signal generator, which reduces the transceiver
 complexity considerably.

 calculates the 'tipping point' where the wireless shortcuts outdo their
 wired counterparts for mm-wave.
 Clearly, this happens only for distances greater than a certain value (here
 7mm).
 So we would be better off using wired links for communicating to distances
 less than 7mm, and the opposite thereafter.
 This demands that we employ both wired and wireless links on our network
 and use the one that suits our purpose better.
 This ambivalence of paradigms is called a '
\series bold
hybrid
\series default
' network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hybrid network, not only does better because it selects the best of
 two paradigms, but also because it can interleave the tasks between two
 distinct networks.
 For example, the wired network could be ear-marked for the high priority
 control packets, whereas the wireless network could be assigned the task
 of bulk data transfer.
 During the process of access contention, the nodes could contend for a
 channel and all the while the current channel 'owner' would transfer its
 data over the channel.
 By the time the current 'owner' is done , the next 'owner' would have been
 decided, which immediately gains control.
 This interleaving potentially reduces the contention overhead to zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of these benefits, it is by default assumed that the presence of
 wireless network implies the presence of wired.
 So, we usually refer to the hybrid network as just

The high frequency paradigms at the high end UWB and beyond allows enough
 room to distribute the entire bandwidth into multiple channels of equal
 bandwidth seperated by guard bands.
 Such waves have characteristics that their signal has very short pulse

 A WCube is recursively built 2D structure.
 A high-level WCube is composed of low level ones.
 The level of WCube

 is the most basic building block that is used to construct larger WCubes.It
 is represented by a single wireless router that is responsible for a cluster
 of m = 16 base routers of the baseline CMesh, thus comprising 4m nodes.
 An n-level WCube, incorporating the baseline 
\begin_inset Formula $k-way$

 CMesh (with a cluster of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 base routers associated with a single wireless router), can support up
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{2n}√óm√ók$

 Practical considerations force us to pin 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 at 16.
 This gives us the maximum number of nodes that can be supported as

After the qualifiers that any topology could choose to conform to, we now

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bus topology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the bus topology each node is connected to a single central wire.
 A signal from the source travels in both directions to all cores connected
 on the bus cable until it finds the intended recipient.
 The nodes that are not the recepient just ignore the data after reading
 the packet or are pre-programmed by the controller to ignore it altogether.
 Alternatively, if the addresss matches the node address, the data is accepted.
 Since the bus topology consists of only one wire, it is rather inexpensive
 to implement when compared to other topologies.
 However, the low cost of implementing the technology is offset by the high
 cost of arbitration and management.
 Additionally, it can be a the single point of failure.

In the context of wireless NoCs, the trivial implementation of a bus consists
 of nodes, each armed with a trasceiver pair and an antenna.
 The range of transmitter is high enough to contact any receiver on the
 chip.
 There is a single channel and all contend for it, with the selected node
 getting chance to transmit.
 It thus emulates a bus, providing a one hop transmission and a single channel.

In Star topology every node is connected to central node called hub or switch.
 The switch is the server and the nodes are the clients.
 The network does not necessarily have to resemble a star to be classified
 as a star network, but all of the nodes on the network must be connected
 to one central entity.
 All traffic that traverses the network passes through the central hub.
 The hub acts as a signal repeater.
 The star topology is considered the easiest topology to design and implement.
 An advantage of the star topology is the simplicity of adding additional
 nodes.
 The primary disadvantage of the star topology is that the hub represents
 a single point of failure.

Media Access Control (MAC) protocols
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Flow, vaguely is defined as a sequence of packets from source node to the
 destination node.
 In the wired NoC, flows contend for a specific router or link.
 But the scenario in WiNoCs is quite different owing to the single (handful
 of) channels available for communication.
 Also, since the system is distributed, synchronization is a difficult art
 to perfect.
 The sharing protocol needs to partition the bandwidth well across flows
 and nodes which are in transmissions range (called contention domains)
 of each other.
 Further we have to deal with issues like hidden-node and exposed-node problem.
 Contention can be broadly classified into two types:

 is caused by nodes along the same flow contend among themselves for access

ate nodes can forward.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Inter-flow contention
\series default
 arises when multiple flows pass through the same region.
 The forwarding nodes of a flow encounter competition from not only their
 own flow but also other flows passing through them or their vicinity.
 The network will be seriously congested if the source nodes inject more
 packets into the crossing flows than the nodes in these contention domains
 can forward.

CSMA/CA

\begin_layout Standard
Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) is a network
 multiple access method in which carrier sensing is used, but nodes attempt
 to avoid collisions by transmitting only when the channel is sensed to
 be "idle".
 However, this check doesn't ensure absence of collision or even detection
 (without use of explicit ECC codes, which is not a very likely prospect
 on a chip).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For removing the hidden terminal problem, one needs to implement a seperate
 RTS-CTS protocol which itself is too much of a temporal overhead, not to
 mention the additional circuit complexity that needs to be added.
 Exposed terminal problem is a still more difficult issue to solve, which
 if left that way, would eat into the effective bandwidth of the system.
\end_layout

, it is a synchroized and distributed MAC protocol.
 It uses a binary countdown mechanism to resolve contention.
 The contending nodes pick up random number inside a range and forward it
 to the intended recipient.
 The receiver then operates upon the bits, and after a few rounds of shortlistin
g, arrives at the winner sender.
 It then proceeds to inform the sender that it may start the transmission.
 Thus, transmission is broken down into following four steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Initialize
\series default
 : involves choosing the random number and associated operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Contention

: contend for the channel by conveying the randomly chosen number to recipient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 : see if the channel authorizes the request.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If yes 
\series bold
Transmit.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Else decrease size of range in which random number was chosen (this improves
 the probability of being selected the next time) and contend for the channel
 again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The above step ensures fairness as the node contending for sufficient amount
 of time is guaranteed to get a turn after some time.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Interestingly, the fact that receiver selects the final sender completely
 alleviates the issues of hidden terminal and exposed terminal problem.
 Removal of hidden terminal is very important as it has a bearing on the
 net throughput.
 Similarly, removing exposed terminal issue improves the channel utilization.

SD-MAC utilizes two layers of communication - employing the wireless backbone

 Synchronization is done through the faster medium - that is the wireless

TDMA is a channel access method used for shared method for shared medium
 network.
 It can accommodate multiple users in a same frequency channel by dividing
 the frequency channel usage in time slots 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ftc"

\end_inset

.
 In TDMA method the time axis is divided into a number of time slots, which
 are pre-assigned to different nodes.
 Each node has right to transmit freely during that slot assigned to it
 and all the system resources are devoted to it during that slot.
 Every such period is known as frame or cycle.
 In basic TDMA each node has exactly one slot in every frame.
 The more general TDMA schemes in which more slots are assigned to one node
 within a frame is referred to as generalized TDMA.
 For proper coordination of nodes in TDMA the nodes must be synchronized
 so that each node knows exactly when and for how long it can transmit.
 It is useful in the lower frequency regions like mm-wave, due to limitations
 in the available bandwidth and complexity of transceiver designs, having
 multiple non-overlapping channels is not an option.
\end_layout

In this scheme, the particular wireless node possessing the token can broadcast
 Ô¨Çits into the wireless medium.
 All other hubs will receive the Ô¨Çit as their antennas are tuned to the
 same frequency band.
 When the destination address matches the address of the receiving hub then
 the Ô¨Çit is accepted for further routing.
 It is routed either to a core in the subnet of that hub or to an adjacent
 hub.
 The token is released to the next wireless node after all Ô¨Çits belonging
 to a single packet at the current token-holding hub are transmitted.
 But the token passing protocol does not scale well with increasing number
 of wireless nodes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the above discussed protocol differs from pure TDMA in one, it
 doesn't relinquish the token at the end of time slot , but at the end of
 packet transmission, second, the token passing delay eats into the time
 slot.
 SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the token return period is bound to increase alongside the
 number of wireless nodes.
 This means that the time taken for acquiring the wireless medium by a node
 also increases.
 In order to solve these problems we need to look at other options.

CDMA

\begin_layout Standard
CDMA utilizes orthogonal codes to allow multiple nodes to use the same channel
 at the same time
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 The idea is to have one from a set of orthogonal codes available at each
 of the nodes.
 While sending a packet, the sender node multiplies the data with the chip-code
 of the receiver.
 This encoded data thus created becomes a noise (that is automatically eliminate
d) to every node other than the receiver.
 On receiving the data, the receiver multiplies data with its chip-code
 and gets the original data back.

 In FDMA the whole frequency band is divided into the sub bands, and every
 sub band serves a single user, so every node has its own transmission frequency
 band and a receiver band.
 Guard bands are inserted between these frequency bands to prevent signal
 from one band to 'bleed' into another.

.Fast-forwarding attempts to forward a packet once it is received .
 In this way, we can prevent source node from injecting new packets before
 the previous packet of the same flow traverses out of its contention domain.
 Thus we propose a prioritized forwarding scheme, receiver priority , which
 can be easily incorporated into the SD-MAC protocol by assigning prioritized
 contention numbers for binary countdown.
 The basic idea is to assign higher priority to the downstream node of the
 same flow.
 We reserve the MSB as the receiver priority bit, ‚Äò1‚Äô indicating tha t the
 current node just receives a packet; ‚Äò0‚Äô

XY Routing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
XY routing is one of the most primitive and standard routing algorithms
 that is both shortest path (for wired mesh networks) and deadlock free.
 Its amazingly simple implementation means it consumes minimal hardware
 and computatational power.
 Due to this very property, it is often the protocol of choice in real life
 NoCs.
 However, it suffers from acute load-imbalance and latency issues becuase
 it doesn't take congestion into account.
 In wireless routing, XY is no longer the shortest path because of the non
 uni-dimensional (diagonal) paths available (as shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).

Location Based Routing (LBR)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the name says, LBR uses the source and destination nodes to decide the
 next node in route.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "5948560"

\end_inset

 has developed LBR as an extension of GAR (Geographically Aided Routing)
 introducing lower latency and deadlock avoidance.
 It uses LBR in a multichannel environment using UWB-I.
 Basically it uses the idea that the range of a wireless transceiver can
 go beyond the one hop that wired links can connect.
 After the wireless nodes are placed on the chip and their trasmission range
 is determined, we get a McWiNoC with static yet configurable topology.
 GAR essentially uses the relative coordinates of nodes to decide the route,
 as does LBR.

 The responsibilities of addressing and routing are vested in the network
 layer.
 It employs a hierarchical address scheme where 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

logical address
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 is calculated as 
\begin_inset Formula $<CoreID,internalID>$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $CoreID$

 is ID of the IP whereas the internalID is address of the memory location
 or register inside core.
 In the adaptive region aided routing that the design uses, each RF node
 divides the chip plane from it‚Äôs own perspective.
 Each region has region header and four border coordinates define a region.
 It uses region delimitation for routing which in turn can be split into
 3 steps 
\end_layout

 hop count, expected transmission time and path interference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mutual overlapping elimination - If the nodes in the overlapping area belong
 to only one of the overlapped regions, simple overlapping occurs.
 Otherwise, if the nodes in the overlapping area belong to different overlapped
 regions, mutual overlapping occurs.
 Eliminating these overlapping regions makes sure the regions under consideratio
n are mutually exclusive.

 proposes an adaptive wormhole packet switching based routing.
 Packets are composed of 64-bit flits and each individual packet may be
 transmitted using wireless or wired or both.
 This decision is taken on the basis of location of source and destination
 nodes.
 The routing algorithm uses the wired links for nodes lying in the same
 subnet.
 The algorithm also takes into account the buffer status.
 Combining all these metrics, routing algo is adaptive with a parameter

 dynamically using these metrics.

Communication data traversing an interconnection network exhibits temporal
 variance.
 In other words, the level of burstiness or packets per unit time is not
 constant and varies from one cycle to the next.Uniformity in traffic makes
 predictions possible and optimizations effective.
 Thus ability to deal with bursty traffic is a desired trait in networks.

\begin_layout Standard
The traffic generated by F1() is much more bursty as it initially buffers
 all the computed data and then messages all at once.
 If the data is being sent through a heavily contended route, it is very
 likely to stall.
 In contrast, F2() interleaves it's computation with the message passing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The factor of 'burstiness' tries to model the frequency and size of these
 bursts.
 Effectively, it tries to reflect the on-chip traffic self-similarity where
 traffic burst patterns repeat themselves over time.
 Burstiness modeling uses the Hurst parameter, 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5<H\leq1$
\end_inset

, which defines the level of self-similarity.
 The closer H is to 1 the higher the level of burstiness.

 To avoid overrunning a slow receiver, the sender deliberately limits its
 injection rate.
 This is an example of an application's effort of trying to smooth the burstines
s to achieve better throughput.
 As shown in the paper, the results can be quite dramatic, and the network's
 bandwidth saturates at a much higher level of traffic when bandwidth matching
 is employed.

Distribution

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is probably the most famous distribution and is used in some way or
 other in every model.
 The issue with it is that the uniformity tends to distribute the load pretty
 evenly.
 Thus, even routing algorithms or topologies with poor load balancing acumen
 perform well in this distribution providing misleading benchmark numbers.
 To avoid this, another paradigm of synthetic traffic is used called permutation
 traffic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Permutation traffic

 Its primary idea is to generate flows between pairs of nodes.
 So, for a node

 can be calculated using some given function 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $d=\pi(s)$

 These are considered a better parameter to benchmark a topology/routing
 algorithm because they focus on node-node pair traffic which yields more
 realistic distributions than random traffic.
