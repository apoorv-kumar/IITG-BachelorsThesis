abstract = {We report the fabrication and accurate measurement of propagation and bending losses in single-mode silicon waveguides with submicron dimensions fabricated on silicon-on-insulator wafers. Owing to the small sidewall surface roughness achieved by processing on a standard 200mm CMOS fabrication line, minimal propagation losses of 3.6{\textpm}0.1dB/cm for the TE polarization were measured at the telecommunications wavelength of 1.5{\textmu}m. Losses per 90{\textordmasculine} bend are measured to be 0.086{\textpm}0.005dB for a bending radius of 1{\textmu}m and as low as 0.013{\textpm}0.005dB for a bend radius of 2{\textmu}m. These record low numbers can be used as a benchmark for further development of silicon microphotonic components and circuits.},

abstract ={Polarized infrared optical emission was observed from a carbon nanotube ambipolar field-effect transistor (FET). An effective forward-biased p-n junction, without chemical dopants, was created in the nanotube by appropriately biasing the nanotube device. Electrical measurements show that the observed optical emission originates from radiative recombination of electrons and holes that are simultaneously injected into the undoped nanotube. These observations are consistent with a nanotube FET model in which thin Schottky barriers form at the source and drain contacts. This arrangement is a novel optical recombination radiation source in which the electrons and holes are injected into a nearly field-free region. Sucha source may form the basis for ultrasmall integrated photonic devices.},
